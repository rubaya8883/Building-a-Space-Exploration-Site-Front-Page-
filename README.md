HTML/CSS
I have learnt:-
adding background image in css
background-size: cover
adding animated image(webp/gif)
imported and use google font
HTML <span> tag, which is used for grouping and applying styles to inline elements. It wraps a section of a text for styling purpose.
IDs and Utility Class. why use id ? ans: when a thing is unique then we use id. but class can reuse.
In CSS we use # for an ID, and .(Dot) for a class.
Choose color pallet from the background image and use Color code for the font
how to use text-shadow for readability purpose.
